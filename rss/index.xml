<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here we are, a new month, a new season, and fresh flutter news! Like I said last month, I will try something new, more personal. In this issue, I will not try to read and sum up every links I found, but dive deeper into articles which attracted me more. I hope you will enjoy this experiment. You can still give me your opinion on twitter[<a href="https://twitter.com/triskeon" class="bare">https://twitter.com/triskeon</a>].</p>

<h2 id="_what_to_look_after_em_helloworld_em">What to look after <em>Helloworld</em>?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was crawling the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev">r/FlutterDev</a> channel on Reddit, and I stumbled on this post:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created="1521984751"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/84ihr6/simple_state_management_using_flutterdart_way/?ref=share&ref_source=embed">Simple state management using Flutter/Dart way</a> from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev">r/FlutterDev</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether you like Redux/Flux or not, this is a basic architecture to know. If you are a beginner, and you want to go further the classical <em>Helloworld</em> tutorial, you should read the code on the <a href="https://github.com/netdur/flutter_simple_arch">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I enjoyed it quite a lot. It shows you Redux is not mandatory, and you can afford using Flutter with no particular dependency. You will discover <em>InheritedWidget</em> usage in a project really easy to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To sum up, I discovered that not using Redux can be quite clean and OK. And the idea of rediscovering simple code architecture hyped me a lot.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_embedding_a_flutter_app_on_linux_desktop">Embedding a Flutter app on Linux desktop</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding/tree/master/linux">GitHub directory</a> attracted my eyes. After MacOS last month, this month, Linux desktop. Yay!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an extract of the <em>README</em> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The Flutter Linux Desktop Embedder</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This framework provides the basic functionality for embedding a Flutter app on the Linux desktop. This currently includes support for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Drawing a Flutter view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mouse event handling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s still under heavy development, but that&#8217;s great news, isn&#8217;t it ?</p>

<h2 id="_how_fast_is_flutter">How fast is Flutter?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While I was on Twitter, this post ticked me:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How fast is Flutter? I built a stopwatch app to find out <a href="https://t.co/8FcvcMjHM2">https://t.co/8FcvcMjHM2</a><a href="https://twitter.com/flutterio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@flutterio</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/flutterio?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#flutterio</a></p>&mdash; FlutterDev (@r_FlutterDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/r_FlutterDev/status/975493145550041088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="https://medium.com/@biz84/how-fast-is-flutter-i-built-a-stopwatch-app-to-find-out-9956fa0e40bd">his article</a>, Andrea Bizzotto experimented Flutter execution&#8217;s speed against a native iOS application using Swift. If you are fond of optimisation and performance, this one should tick you too. But be careful! That&#8217;s just one use case, Flutter may have different speed on your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, I was glad to see someone writing about Flutter performances without saying it is far better that other solutions. This bit of objectivity was like some fresh air to me, as I love both native and Flutter development. Flutter is not perfect for every usage (but performances seems to be quite good anyway), keep this is mind and adapt yourself.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_charts">Charts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was waiting for my colleague <a href="http://aloisdeniel.github.io/">Aloïs Deniel</a> to port his cool C# library <a href="https://github.com/aloisdeniel/Microcharts">Microcharts</a> (based on Skia, yay!) to Dart/Flutter, and the <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/charts_flutter">charts_flutter</a> package came to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can discover it through <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-io/beautiful-animated-charts-for-flutter-164940780b8c">this article</a> written by Michael Thomsen. No more excuses not to include charts in your apps!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(BTW, Aloïs, if you read this: I&#8217;m still greedily waiting for Microcharts for Flutter)</p>

<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That few links where the ones which made me tick, I hope you will find some interest reading them, and you will learn as much as I did.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I found this new way of summing up my month in Flutter more pleasant: by writing about my favourite articles, I am way more involved and I can go deeper. I will try to follow this path and improve next month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See you in April!</p>

<h4 id="_keynote_by_tim_sneath">Keynote by Tim Sneath</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tim started with quick presentation of Flutter, no surprise here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He spoke about Dart and why they used it: hot reload, native compilation, language optimisation, open source, ECMA standard. They also officially announced Dart 2 with its strong mode type inference, optional <code>new</code> and <code>const</code> keywords, common behaviours and error messages on all platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We had a presentation of the <a href="https://www.hookle.net/">Hookle</a> application, which was built using Flutter. They choose Flutter to accelerate and ease development on iOS and Android.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, some numbers about Flutter, Dart and contributions. In one sentence: Flutter community is impressive.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_evolving_dart_leaving_the_ocean_and_learn_to_fly_by_leaf_petersen">Evolving Dart: Leaving the ocean and learn to fly by Leaf Petersen</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Dart history: past, now, future. At the beginning, Dart was design to be a great JIT language to replace the flawy JavaScript in the browser. Then they adapted the language by creating Strong Mode. Then, came AOT with Flutter and the new version, Dart 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To extends the language to Dart 2, main challenge was to make a static typing system, who is both developer-friendly and as easy to use as the dynamic typing of Dart 1. Core libraries and tools have been updated to work with Dart 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the future, Dart will include 64-bits integers, optional <code>new</code> and <code>const</code> keywords. They would like to introduce Generic constructors, smarter type promotion, support for language and library evolution, ease between typed and untyped code, and non-nullable types.</p>

<h4 id="_flutter_web_unite_your_code_and_your_team_by_matthew_smith_and_john_ryan">Flutter &amp; Web: Unite your code and your team by Matthew Smith and John Ryan</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AppTree needed to build an app for Android, iOS, and Web. As their Web version was already written in Dart, they tried to move their mobile native application to Flutter, sharing as much Dart code as possible between Flutter and Web.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Their strategy use layers, with abstract views and services to handle platform specific operations. They are using View-Controller-Service layers. Views are simple and only know rendering and user inputs, controllers handle app&#8217;s logic, and services are accessing to external data, like JSON or HTTP requests.
They are using dependencies injection to avoid coupling to ease layer swapping between platforms.</p>

<p>States in Flutter are not that easy to use : <code>StatefulWidget</code> is great, but it can be hard to maintain. <code>InheritedWidgets</code> can solve a part of this, but it is not that optimised. Setting up tests can be hard with in some cases, too.</p>
