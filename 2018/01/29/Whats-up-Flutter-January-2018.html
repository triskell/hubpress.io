<p>This news report on Flutter is just a gathering of links and information about what happened this January. You may find lots of links on Twitter, Reddit, and newsletters, my first sources of information. This is just a way for me to stay up-to-date on Flutter technology, by browsing and reading things about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the first publication, like a proof of concept for me :) As it is not perfect and I need to improve it, I will gladly appreciate to <a href="https://twitter.com/triskeon">get some feedbacks</a> on it.</p>

<h3 id="_flutter_plugin_version_21">Flutter plugin version 21</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Flutter plugin has been <a href="https://news.dartlang.org/2018/01/flutter-plugin-v21-now-available.html">updated to version 21</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It comes with the first version of Flutter Inspector, which adds widget tree visualisation, widget selection between tree and UI, and properties display. There are some improvements with app launch and run, like a message when reloading was successful, some more hyperlinks in console to restart and access files more easily.</p>

<h4 id="_keynote_by_tim_sneath">Keynote by Tim Sneath</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tim started with quick presentation of Flutter, no surprise here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He spoke about Dart and why they used it: hot reload, native compilation, language optimisation, open source, ECMA standard. They also officially announced Dart 2 with its strong mode type inference, optional <code>new</code> and <code>const</code> keywords, common behaviours and error messages on all platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We had a presentation of the <a href="https://www.hookle.net/">Hookle</a> application, which was built using Flutter. They choose Flutter to accelerate and ease development on iOS and Android.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, some numbers about Flutter, Dart and contributions. In one sentence: Flutter community is impressive.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_evolving_dart_leaving_the_ocean_and_learn_to_fly_by_leaf_petersen">Evolving Dart: Leaving the ocean and learn to fly by Leaf Petersen</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Dart history: past, now, future. At the beginning, Dart was design to be a great JIT language to replace the flawy JavaScript in the browser. Then they adapted the language by creating Strong Mode. Then, came AOT with Flutter and the new version, Dart 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To extends the language to Dart 2, main challenge was to make a static typing system, who is both developer-friendly and as easy to use as the dynamic typing of Dart 1. Core libraries and tools have been updated to work with Dart 2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the future, Dart will include 64-bits integers, optional <code>new</code> and <code>const</code> keywords. They would like to introduce Generic constructors, smarter type promotion, support for language and library evolution, ease between typed and untyped code, and non-nullable types.</p>

<h4 id="_let_s_live_code_in_flutter_by_emily_fortuna_matt_sullivan">Let&#8217;s Live code in Flutter by Emily Fortuna &amp; Matt Sullivan</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Emily and Matt are live coding from scratch (with Visual Studio Code, not Android Studio) a Flutter app which finds restaurants around you. Sources are hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/mjohnsullivan/nomnom">nomnom github repository</a>.</p>

<h4 id="_flutter_web_unite_your_code_and_your_team_by_matthew_smith_and_john_ryan">Flutter &amp; Web: Unite your code and your team by Matthew Smith and John Ryan</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>AppTree needed to build an app for Android, iOS, and Web. As their Web version was already written in Dart, they tried to move their mobile native application to Flutter, sharing as much Dart code as possible between Flutter and Web.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Their strategy use layers, with abstract views and services to handle platform specific operations. They are using View-Controller-Service layers. Views are simple and only know rendering and user inputs, controllers handle app&#8217;s logic, and services are accessing to external data, like JSON or HTTP requests.
They are using dependencies injection to avoid coupling to ease layer swapping between platforms.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actually, modified title is <em>Making Dart fast everywhere where Dart VM runs</em>, you are warned. As Flutter uses Dart VM, we are fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dart performances vary between Debug and Release mode. Vyacheslav explains how to monitor performances, and what Dart 2 brings to AOT performances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>States in Flutter are not that easy to use : <code>StatefulWidget</code> is great, but it can be hard to maintain. <code>InheritedWidgets</code> can solve a part of this, but it is not that optimised. Setting up tests can be hard with in some cases, too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A solution is to use layers :</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data layer : retrieve and parse data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Domain layer : up-to-you to choose your preferred solution. In this talk, we are looking to Redux. This is way more easier to test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI layer : widgets, using <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_redux">flutter_redux</a> in this video to optimise the rendering process with <code>StoreConnector</code>.</p>
