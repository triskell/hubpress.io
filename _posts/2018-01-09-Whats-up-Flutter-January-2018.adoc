== Forewords

This news report on Flutter is just a gathering of links and information about what happened this January. You may find lots of links on Twitter, Reddit, and newsletters, my first sources of information. This is just a way for me to stay up-to-date on Flutter technology, by browsing and reading things about it.

This is the first publication, like a proof of concept for me :) As it is not perfect and I need to improve it, I will gladly appreciate to https://twitter.com/triskeon[get some feedbacks] on it.

== News and events

=== Flutter plugin version 21

The Flutter plugin has been https://news.dartlang.org/2018/01/flutter-plugin-v21-now-available.html[updated to version 21].

It comes with the first version of Flutter Inspector, which adds widget tree visualisation, widget selection between tree and UI, and properties display. There are some improvements with app launch and run, like a message when reloading was successful, some more hyperlinks in console to restart and access files more easily.

=== DartConf 2018

https://events.dartlang.org/2018/dartconf/[DartConf 2018] took place on January 23-24. You can find their dedicated https://t.co/FVxqnPvur4[open source Flutter app].

You can watch it now on the dedicated https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIJr3vjxggY7yGcGO7i9BK5[Youtube playlist], or if you prefer to watch the live version, you've got https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk9ZMIQDpUg[Day 1 live recording] and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lLI-hZvGg0[Day 2 live recording].

==== Keynote by Tim Sneath

Tim started with quick presentation of Flutter, no surprise here.

He spoke about Dart and why they used it: hot reload, native compilation, language optimisation, open source, ECMA standard. They also officialy announced Dart 2 with its strong mode type inference, optional `new` and `const` keywords, common behaviors and error messages on all platforms.

We had a presentation of the https://www.hookle.net/[Hookle] application, which was built using Flutter. They choose Flutter to accelerate and ease development on iOS and Android.

Then, some numbers about Flutter, Dart and contributions. In one sentence: Flutter community is impressive.

==== Evolving Dart: Leaving the ocean and learn to fly by Leaf Petersen

A Dart history: past, now, future. At the beginning, Dart was design to be a great JIT language to replace the flawy JavaScript in the browser. Then they adapted the language by creating Strong Mode. Then, came AOT with Flutter and the new version, Dart 2.

To extends the language to Dart 2, main challenge was to make a static typing system, who is both developer-friendly and as easy to use as the dynamic typing of Dart 1. Core libraries and tools have been updated to work with Dart 2.

In the future, Dart will include 64-bits integers, optional `new` and `const` keywords. They would like to introduce Generic constructors, smarter type promotion, support for language and library evolution, ease between typed and untyped code, and non-nullable types.

==== Let's Live code in Flutter by Emily Fortuna & Matt Sullivan

Emily and Matt are live coding from scratch (with Visual Studio Code, not Android Studio) a Flutter app which finds restaurants around you. Sources are hosted on the https://github.com/mjohnsullivan/nomnom[nomnom github repository].

==== Flutter & Web: Unite your code and your team by Matthew Smith and John Ryan

AppTree needed to build an app for Android, iOS, and Web. As their Web version was already written in Dart, they tried to move their mobile native application to Flutter, sharing as much Dart code as possible between Flutter and Web.

Their strategy use layers, with abstract views and services to handle platform specific operations. They are using View-Controller-Service layers. Views are simple and only know rendering and user inputs, controllers handle app's logic, and services are accessing to external data, like JSON or HTTP requests.
They are using dependencies injection to avoid coupling to ease layer swapping between platforms.

==== Making Dart fast on mobile by Vyacheslav Egorov

Actually, modified title is _Making Dart fast everywhere where Dart VM runs_, you are warned. As Flutter uses Dart VM, we are fine.

Dart performances vary between Debug and Release mode. Vyacheslav explains how to monitor performances.
