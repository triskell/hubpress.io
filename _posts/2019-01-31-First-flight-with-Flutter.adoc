Some times ago, I found something I was curious about: [Flutter](https://flutter.io). Let's get started with it.

== What is Flutter ?

Flutter is a mobile SDK allowing you to develop apps for both Android and iOS with a single code base.

_We will get a bit technical to describe Flutter, so you can go to the next section if you don't matter._

So, with Flutter, you've got one base code in https://www.dartlang.org/[Dart], common to all plateforms. However, you can target platform-specific functionality with native code : Java/Kotlin on Android and ObjectiveC/Swift on iOS.

View rendering isn't native. Flutter is using its own optimised rendering engine, based on https://skia.googlesource.com/skia[Skia] and aiming 60 FPS any time, on any device.

Flutter is reactive-oriented, so you will have to get a bit into reactve programmign to use it.

== Install Flutter

That's the easy part. Go to https://flutter.io/[flutter.io], click on https://flutter.io/setup/[Get started], select your operating system, and follow the guide provided.

== Discover the Flutter tool

The Flutter tool is a command line tool. So, next step is to open a command line terminal (Like Bash on Linux, Terminal on OSX, cmd on Windows).

To initialise Flutter and check everything went well during your install, just enter `flutter doctor`. You may have some download to process, just wait a bit in this case. You should then see some information like

```

If everything went well, your should have "√" everywere, except for "Connected devices" if you have no connected mobile or emulator running.

Remember this command, It can help you to diagnose your flutter environment.

To discover what you can do with the Flutter tool, just type `flutter`. You will get somtehing like this :
```
Manage your Flutter app development.

Common commands:

  flutter create <output directory>
    Create a new Flutter project in the specified directory.

  flutter run [options]

Usage: flutter <command> [arguments]

Global options:
-h, --help            Print this usage information.
-v, --verbose         Noisy logging, including all shell commands executed.
-d, --device-id       Target device id or name (prefixes allowed).
    --version         Reports the version of this tool.
    --bug-report      Captures a bug report file to submit to the Flutter team (contains local paths, device
                      identifiers, and log snippets).

But for now we will use Android Studio, which can be much more convenient :)
