I develop mobile apps for my job, native Android using "good" old Java, and cross-platform using [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/). I acknoledge I started with Cordova/Phonegap, but... Yuck, webviews.
Recently I passed my Xamarin developper certification, which does only mean I know the basics about Xamarin. And It was cool: cross-platform, native, C# (and F#!) are so delightful after doing Android's Java only.

And some times ago, I found something I was curious about: [Flutter](https://flutter.io).

== What is flutter ?

Flutter is a mobile SDK allowing you to develop apps for both Android and iOS with a single code base.
