== Forewords


Flutter community is expanding, more and more great content is appearing online. I'm so delighted about it.


You will see in this listing that February was rich. Very rich. That was a lot of reading for me, but I learned a lot. I hope you will, too.
You can send me a word https://twitter.com/triskeon[on twitter] to give me your thoughts about this report.


== News and events


Februeary was short, but full of surprises. To me, the biggest one was the announce of Flutter beta:


+++
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We just announced our first beta at Mobile World Congress! Thank you to our community for helping us reach this milestone. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MWC18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MWC18</a><br><br>Learn more here? <a href="https://t.co/uP8IwQakBl">https://t.co/uP8IwQakBl</a> <a href="https://t.co/SOIvWMcxjs">pic.twitter.com/SOIvWMcxjs</a></p>&mdash; Flutter (@flutterio) <a href="https://twitter.com/flutterio/status/968486429754933248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2018</a></blockquote>

Now, you can attract your colleagues to do Flutter dev. No more "But, it's still alpha" excuses. You will achieve to convince them with this video:

And finally, Google created a Github repository: https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding[Desktop Embedding for Flutter]. Yep, that's great news, but be careful: it only target macOS for now, and it's still under heavy development.

== Conclusion


Whoa! February was short, but the community is more productive every day. I hope it will continue to grow that way for a long time. However, collecting links and reading every articles was a lot a work, and I wonder if it is still pertinent. Next month, I may give a try to a more personal and less time consuming form of this report. I'm not all decided about it, you will see it at the end of March. 


See you next month !
