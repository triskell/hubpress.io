== Forewords

Here we are, a new month, a new season, and fresh flutter news! Like I said last month, I will try something new, more personal. In this issue, I will not try to read and sum up every links I found, but dive deeper into articles which attracted me more. I hope you will enjoy this expermiment. You can still give me your opinion on twitter[https://twitter.com/triskeon].

== What to look after _Helloworld_?

I was crawling the https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev[r/FlutterDev] channel on Reddit, and I stumbled on this post:

Whether you like Redux/Flux or not, this is a basic architecture to know. If you are a beginner, and you want to go further the classical _Helloworld_ tutorial, you should read the code on the https://github.com/netdur/flutter_simple_arch[GitHub repository].

I enjoyed it quite a lot. It shows you Redux is not mandatory, and you can afford using Flutter with no particular dependency. You will discover _InheritedWidget_ usage in a project really easy to understand.c
