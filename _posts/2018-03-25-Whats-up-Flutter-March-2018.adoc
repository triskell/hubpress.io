== Forewords

Here we are, a new month, a new season, and fresh flutter news! Like I said last month, I will try something new, more personal. In this issue, I will not try to read and sum up every links I found, but dive deeper into articles which attracted me more. I hope you will enjoy this expermiment. You can still give me your opinion on twitter[https://twitter.com/triskeon].

== What to look after _Helloworld_?

I was crawling the https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev[r/FlutterDev] channel on Reddit, and I stumbled on this post:

<blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created="1521984751"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/84ihr6/simple_state_management_using_flutterdart_way/?ref=share&ref_source=embed">Simple state management using Flutter/Dart way</a> from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev">r/FlutterDev</a></blockquote>

Whether you like Redux/Flux or not, this is a basic architecture to know. If you are a beginner, and you want to go further the classical _Helloworld_ tutorial, you should read the code on the https://github.com/netdur/flutter_simple_arch[GitHub repository].

I enjoyed it quite a lot. It shows you Redux is not mandatory, and you can afford using Flutter with no particular dependency. You will discover _InheritedWidget_ usage in a project really easy to understand.

To sum up, I discovered that not using Redux can be quite clean and OK. And the idea of rediscovering simple code architecture hyped me a lot.

== Embedding a Futter app on Linux desktop

This https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding/tree/master/linux[Github directory] attracted my eyes. After MacOS last month, this month, Linux desktop. Yay!

Here is an extract of the _README_ file:

> *The Flutter Linux Desktop Embedder*
>
> This framework provides the basic functionality for embedding a Flutter app on the Linux desktop. This currently includes support for:
>
> - Drawing a Flutter view.
> - Mouse event handling.

That's still under heavy development, but that's great news, isn't it ?

== How fast 

While I was on Twitter, this post ticked me:
