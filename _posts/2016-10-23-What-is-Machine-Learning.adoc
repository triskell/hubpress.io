This is the first post in a series which aims to explain Machine Learning concepts with simple words and fun drawings, named https://triskell.github.io/2016/11/15/Inky-Machine-Learning.html[InkyML]. You can find some explanations about the series and the list of posts https://triskell.github.io/2016/11/15/Inky-Machine-Learning.html[on this page].

_Disclaimer: I'm not pro in Machine Learning and English is not my native language. So, I woud appreciate comments and advices to improve. ;)_
