Welcome to my series of posts _Inky Machine Learning_ or just _InkyML_. It does not aim to be exhaustive nor specific, but to be fun and easy to understand.

This will be a first approach to Machine Learning (or ML) explained simply and drawn using ink by a guy with inky fingers (that's why it's called "inky"). It just mean to be fun, and to explain the very basic concepts and vocabulary of ML.

Here are the parts of the series : 

* *Part 1* : https://triskell.github.io/2016/10/23/What-is-Machine-Learning.html[What is Machine Learning ?]
* *Part 2* : https://triskell.github.io/2016/11/13/Supervised-Learning-and-Unsupervised-Learning.html[Supervised Learning & Unsupervised Learning]
* *To be continued...*

I will update this list when I will publish new posts.

I hope you will enjoy it, and have fun with Machine Learning. Just because _Machine Learning is fun_ !
