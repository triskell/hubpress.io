In the first part of this series we discovered https://triskell.github.io/2016/10/23/What-is-Machine-Learning.html[what is Machine Learning]. You can find some explanations about the series and the list of posts https://triskell.github.io/2016/11/08/Machine-Learning-explained-to-my-girlfriend.html[on this page] (Seriously, you should read it before reading this page, if you haven't yet!).

Now, let's have a look to *Supervised Learning* and *Unsupervised Learning*. Enjoy !

_Disclaimer: I'm not pro in Machine Learning and English is not my native language. So, I woud appreciate comments and advices to improve. ;)_
