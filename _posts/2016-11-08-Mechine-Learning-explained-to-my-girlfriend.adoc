Welcome to my series of posts _Machine Learning explained to my girlfirend_. It does not aim to be exhaustive nor specific, but to be fun and easy to understand.

Here are the parts of the series : 

* *Part 1* : https://triskell.github.io/2016/10/23/What-is-Machine-Learning.html[What is Machine Learning ?]
* *Part 2* : (Work in progress) Supervised Learning & unsupervised Learning. 

I will update this list when I will publish new posts.

I hope you will enjoy it, and have fun with Machine Learning. Just because _Machine Learning is fun_ !
