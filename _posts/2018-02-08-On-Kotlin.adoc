== Overview

* Protected against NPE
* Lambdas (java only has from Java 8)
* Class extensions
* Frequently updated
* Operator overload
* No semicolon
* ...

=== Requirements

Android Studio + Kotlin Support to enable

=== Convert Java to Kotlin

Android Studio handles it, but not that perfect (can have side effects!)

=== Ressources

* Kotlin website (TODO:LINK)
* Goolge ewebsite (TODO:LINK)
* Book Kotlin in action
* Kotlin Weekly http://kotlinweekly.net/

=== Guidelines

* Official guidelines Google (TOOD:LINK)
* Official guidelines JetBrains (TODO:LINK)
* Android studio code formatter

== Bases

=== Types

`val`:

* immutable
* only one init
* can be const

`var`:

* mutable

Best to use `val` by default and change to `var` only when needed.

Values are statically typed.
Types can be inferre if value is set on the declaration line.
No primitive type. Everything is an object. When best than primitive typed in Java, where you can have problems converting between primitives types and equivalent object types.
Nullable types, but you have to precise that type is nullable (non-inferred) with symbol `?`.
Non-null by default.

`!!` operator can, be used to disable nullable check on a value. Beware! Can create NPE.

`lateinit`:
* object not null but no value on initialisation
* Have to be a `var` and non-nullable.
* non instanciated on compilation or creation (like on Android views)

`lazy`:
* Object non-null
* Have to be a `val` non-nullable.
* Instanciated using an expression computed on first access to value.

=== Functions

* Methods declared using `fun`
* By default, implicitly returns `Unit`
* Parameters are always immutables (`val`)
* Can return multiple values
* Can use arguments by default
* You can reference arguments by name
* A single instruction function can be called like an expression
* Can have variable numbers of arguments of the same type (like Java) using `vararg` which creates an array of arguments

Can create local functions : function inside an other function (only accessible in it).

=== Flow control

==== If/Else
* Like Java
* No ternary operator
* Can be used as expressions : `val value = if(condition) value1 else value2` (with or without `{}`)
* Elvis operator `?:` returns a default value if given experssion is null.

==== When
* Equivalent to Java's `switch`
* Can compute expressions on each case
* Default value given by `else` keyword
* can take only one "argument"
* can use ranges as test expressions

==== For

* Can work with ranges (begin..end)

==== ForEach

* Like Java
* Can use lambdas

== Classes

* Like classical POO
* Contains `var`, `val`, methods.
* Class name can be different than file name.

=== Constructor

* Always have 1 primary constuctor
* Can have none or multiple secondary constructors using  `constructor`. Have to call primary constructor.
* Variables can be declared :
	- in primary constructor using `val` or `val`
	- in class declaration
	- in `init` block, executed after any constructor

=== Object creation

* Like Java, but with no `new` keyword.

=== Properties

* `val` or `var`
* Implicit getters/setters (implicitely created and called)
* Can be declared using `get` and `set`

=== Visibility

* Public, by default. Accessible everywhere
* Private. Accessible in class only.
* Protected. Priate + child classes.
* Internal. Accessible in module.

=== Data classes

* Automatically defines :
	- `equals()`/`hashcode()` 
	- `toString()` 
	- `copy()`
* Useful for POJO
* Can contain methods since Kotlin 1.1

=== Inheritance

* `final` class by default
* `open` keyword to allow inheritance

=== Nested/inner classes

* Like Java
* No access to extern class, by default.
* `inner` keyword to access extern class attributes

=== Generics

* Like Java, but without wildcard types. You will need to use a base class and make a cast to store different child classes.

== Companions & objects

=== Companion

* Only one per class (if not named)
* Like an inner static class
* Can contain constants
* Can contain static methods

==== Static & const

* No static methods :
	- use companion methods
	- `@JvmStatic` to access it statically (companion is static, but its methods are not by default)
* `val` to make immutable value (but not known at compile time)
* `const val` is immutable and its value is known at compile time. Have to be used in companion only.

=== Object

* Singleton object (can declare anonymous objects)
* Can be used to create anonymous object.

== Collections & lists

=== Collections

* Like Java
* Not same creation :
	- arrayOf()
	- arrayOfNull(size)
	- Array(size, function)

=== Lists

* like Java
	- MutableList<T>  (interface)
	- Arraylist<T>    (implementation)
* Instanciation with
	- listOf()
	- mutableListOf()

=== Sets

* like Java
 	- MutableSet<T>
	- HashSet<T>
* Instanciation
	- setOf()
	- mutableSetOf()

=== Maps

* like Java
* like Lists & Sets
* performances of mapOf() are bad with great number of elements
* Better use ArrayMap only from support library ! ;)

== Lambdas

=== It

* `it` is the curren tinctance passed to the function
* can be renamed with `->`

=== Filter

To filter list

=== find

Find one element in list

=== map

Apply a function to each item in list

=== flatMap

like map, but returns multiple values

=== sort

to sort list

=== first/last

get first or last item matching predicate

=== sum by

add all item in list

=== maxBy & minBy

get max item or min item in list

=== plus & minus

add or substract on each item of list

=== toList & toSet

create new list or new set (no reference)

=== forEach

loop on each item, no return

=== Reduce

apply a function on each couple of element to return only one result

=== disctinctBy

get unique list of items (eliminates duplicates)
